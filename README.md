# React User Management Template

React User Management Template version follows latest industry best practices and uses Redux as a state manager. This version is a great choice when you want to be in control of your own codebase and decide on development approaches that are the best for your project. Webpack Module Bundler and Yarn as a package manager are under the hood.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of React User Management Template on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/flatlogic/user-management-template.git
```

#### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](package.json) file.

#### 3 Run `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode with nodejs-backend (https://github.com/flatlogic/nodejs-backend)

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

#### 4. Run `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
